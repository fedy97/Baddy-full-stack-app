\chapter{Architectural Design}
    \section{Overview}
	The purpose of this chapter is to detail the approach and the tecniques used during the development process of the application. Given the nature of the application, it is important to 
	clarify the plan that guided all the phases of the software development in order to achieve the final result.
	
	\section{Development approach}
    The development of the application has been carried out following a test-driven approach. In particular the components have been developed in parallel to a series of
	\textbf{widget tests} written with the purpose of matching the developed component with the expected behaviour. The order of the components has been established considering
	a bottom-up development plan, which starts from simple and atomic components used used to model more complex widgets and view. In particular basic widgets like buttons, boxes, 
	forms and other frequently used components have been developed first and immediately unit-tested.
